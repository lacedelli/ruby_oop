# ruby_oop

## Thougths before going in
I definitely have mixed thoughts on this one, to be honest, while I think that the challenges themselves may not be that big of a challenge, there's a lingering doubt that I have regarding the way that I'm gonna organize my code, and, it's a thing that will come to me once I read more OOP code and develop my own, but I am worried that I may overcomplicate the inner workings of the code in a misguided intention of "making it optimal" or "More OOP," whatever that means.

I'll work on them, and after finishing it I will send it to some friends to see if they have any pointers, structure-wise, on how I can improve.
