# ruby_oop

## Thougths before going in
I definitely have mixed thoughts on this one, to be honest, while I think that the challenges themselves may not be that big of a challenge, there's a lingering doubt that I have regarding the way that I'm gonna organize my code, and, it's a thing that will come to me once I read more OOP code and develop my own, but I am worried that I may overcomplicate the inner workings of the code in a misguided intention of "making it optimal" or "More OOP," whatever that means.

I'll work on them, and after finishing it I will send it to some friends to see if they have any pointers, structure-wise, on how I can improve.

## Thoughts after finishing
The code is a mess, I don't know that much programming at all and even I have that conviction, but, alas; I'm fed up with this project after a long-ass time having spent procrastinating on it, maybe in the future I will come back to make a more succint and better working version of the game, but as of right now it's current iteration will do, however bad it may be.

My original goal of using different classes for each of the segmented functionalities was accomplished to a certain degree, which was the thing that I dreaded the most in some ways. I mentioned this previously: the fact that I'm making myself use vim to code these lessons; I won't lie, I almost gave in and started to use geanie or literally anything else, due to how much of a nightmare things seem to be using this software, but the most likely reason for my disliking of it for the time being is probably my unfamiliarity with it.

anyway, that's it for this one. See you on the next one.
